# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub Incident Visualizer is a tool designed to generate visual representations of GitHub's historical incidents by severity over time. The tool will fetch incident data from GitHub's status API, process this data to categorize incidents by severity and time period, and generate a PNG image showing the distribution of incidents over time. This visualization will be automated through a GitHub Action that can be scheduled to run periodically, ensuring the visualization remains up-to-date.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Retrieval

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to automatically fetch GitHub incident data from the official API, so that I can have access to the most current incident information without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL fetch incident data from https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/incidents.json
2. WHEN the API request fails THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful error message and exit gracefully
3. WHEN the API response format changes THEN the system SHALL log an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the system successfully retrieves data THEN it SHALL parse and store all relevant incident information for processing

### Requirement 2: Data Processing

**User Story:** As a system analyst, I want the tool to process and categorize GitHub incidents by severity and time, so that I can understand the distribution and trends of different incident types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN incident data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL categorize incidents by severity (at least major and minor categories)
2. WHEN processing incidents THEN the system SHALL organize them by month
3. WHEN an incident has multiple updates THEN the system SHALL use the initial creation date for time categorization
4. WHEN incidents are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain the integrity of the original severity classification from GitHub
5. IF additional severity categories exist beyond major and minor THEN the system SHALL include them in the visualization

### Requirement 3: Visualization Generation

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want to see a clear visual representation of GitHub incidents over time, so that I can quickly understand patterns and trends in service reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a PNG image showing incidents by severity over time
2. WHEN generating the visualization THEN the system SHALL use different colors to distinguish between incident severity types
3. WHEN displaying time periods THEN the system SHALL organize data by month
4. WHEN creating the visualization THEN the system SHALL include appropriate labels, legend, and title
5. WHEN the visualization is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure the image is of sufficient resolution to be clearly readable

### Requirement 4: GitHub Action Integration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the visualization to be automatically generated through a GitHub Action, so that the data remains current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Action runs THEN the system SHALL execute the visualization generation process
2. WHEN the GitHub Action completes successfully THEN the system SHALL save the generated PNG to a predetermined location
3. WHEN the GitHub Action is configured THEN it SHALL allow for scheduled execution (e.g., monthly)
4. IF the GitHub Action fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error logs for troubleshooting
5. WHEN the GitHub Action runs THEN it SHALL use Python for all processing and visualization tasks

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be well-structured and maintainable, so that future enhancements and bug fixes can be implemented efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is developed THEN it SHALL follow Python best practices and style guidelines
2. WHEN functions and classes are created THEN they SHALL include appropriate documentation
3. WHEN the system is implemented THEN it SHALL include basic error handling and logging
4. WHEN the project is structured THEN it SHALL use modular design for easy maintenance
5. WHEN the code is completed THEN it SHALL include basic tests to verify functionality
